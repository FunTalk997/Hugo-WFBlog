# About the author
Hey, it's `WaterFish`. If you come across any strange typography, irrational links, or the sudden smell of baking bread on this blog, don't worry, it's all traces of me trying to master the technology.

I confess that, to me, technology is like a pirated version of a grimoire. But that doesn't stop me from the task of translating digital whimsy into words. I'll share my awkward moments in the face of technical dilemmas here, as well as the weird inspirations I've had in my mistakes.

If you are also a tech geek, or you are immersed in the sea of code, then welcome to my blog! We laugh at technology together, get rid of complexity, and enjoy the journey of discovery.

# About blogs
Originally built 2022-07-15, it started as an interest and ended.

This site is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the theme is [NewBee](https://github.com/xioyito/NewBee).

I hope it will become a platform for me to record what I have learned and thought, and I also hope that the people who visit this station can gain something.
