Regular expressions are special character sequences that help you conveniently check if a string matches a pattern. 

Python has included the re module since version 1.5, providing Perl-style regular expression patterns.

The re module provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python.

The compile function converts a regular expression pattern into a regex object which has a set of methods to implement regular expression matching and substitution. This module also provides functions that use regular expressions on strings without compiling them first.

This section mainly introduces commonly used regular expression handling functions in Python.

# re.match function

The `re.match()` function is provided by Python's `re` module to match a regular expression pattern at the beginning of a string. It tries to match the regex pattern starting from the beginning of the string, returning a match object if successful, else None.

The function signature is:

```python
re.match(pattern, string, flags=0)
```

Where:

- `pattern`: The regular expression pattern to match.
- `string`: The string to match against. 
- `flags`: Optional flags to modify the matching.

Here are some example usages of `re.match()`:

```python
import re

pattern = r"hello"
text = "hello, world!"

match_result = re.match(pattern, text)
if match_result:
    print("Match found:", match_result.group())
else:
    print("No match")
    
# Output: Match found: hello
```

Here we use `re.match()` to try to match "hello" at the start of string `text`, and since the string does start with "hello", the match succeeds.

Note that `re.match()` only matches at the beginning of the string. If the pattern does not occur at the start, the match will fail and return None. 

If you need to match anywhere in the string instead of just the beginning, consider using `re.search()`. Also, use `re.findall()` if you want to find all occurrences that match the pattern in the string.

# re.search function

The `re.search()` function is another regex matching function provided by Python's `re` module. Unlike `re.match()`, `re.search()` searches the entire string and returns the first match. It returns a match object if a match is found, else None.

The function signature is:

```python
re.search(pattern, string, flags=0)
```

Where:

- `pattern`: The regex pattern to search for.
- `string`: The string to search in.
- `flags`: Optional flags to modify the matching.

Here are some examples of using `re.search()`:

```python
import re

pattern = r"world"
text = "hello, world!" 

search_result = re.search(pattern, text)
if search_result:
    print("Match found:", search_result.group())
else:
    print("No match")
    
# Output: Match found: world
```

Here we use `re.search()` to find "world" in string `text`, and since "world" does occur in the string, the search succeeds. 

Note that `re.search()` searches the entire string, not just the beginning. To match specifically at the start, continue using `re.match()`.

Similar to `re.match()`, use `re.findall()` if you want to find all occurrences in the string.

# re.sub function

The `re.sub()` function is used to search and replace regex patterns in a string. It is a powerful tool in Python's `re` module, useful for text substitution, templating, etc.

The function signature is:

```python
re.sub(pattern, replacement, string, count=0, flags=0)
```

Where:

- `pattern`: The regex pattern to match. 
- `replacement`: The substitution string.
- `string`: The original string to perform replacements on.
- `count`: Optional argument to specify max number of replacements. Default is 0 for all.
- `flags`: Optional flags to modify the matching.

Here are some examples of using `re.sub()`:

```python
import re

pattern = r"\d+"  # Match one or more digits 
text = "There are 123 apples and 456 bananas."

new_text = re.sub(pattern, "X", text)
print(new_text)

# Output: There are X apples and X bananas.
```

Here we use `re.sub()` to replace all digits in the text with "X". 

```python
import re

pattern = r"\d+"  
text = "There are 123 apples and 456 bananas."

new_text = re.sub(pattern, "X", text, count=1) 
print(new_text)

# Output: There are X apples and 456 bananas.
```

Here we use the `count` argument to limit replacements to 1, so only the first number is replaced.

```python
import re

pattern = r"\b(\w+)\s+\1\b"  # Match repeated words
text = "Hello Hello, world world."  

new_text = re.sub(pattern, r"\1", text)
print(new_text)

# Output: Hello, world.
```

Here we use `re.sub()` with capture groups to replace repeated words with a single instance.

# re.split function

The `re.split()` function in Python's `re` module is used to split a string based on a regex pattern match. It splits the string into a list, with each element being a substring split based on the pattern matches.

The function signature is:

```python
re.split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0) 
```

Where:

- `pattern`: The regex pattern to match.
- `string`: The original string to split.
- `maxsplit`: Optional argument to specify max number of splits. Default 0 is unlimited splits. 
- `flags`: Optional flags to modify the matching.

Here is a simple example:

```python
import re

pattern = r"\s+"  # Match one or more whitespace 
text = "Hello   world. How    are  you?"

split_result = re.split(pattern, text)
print(split_result) 

# Output: ['Hello', 'world.', 'How', 'are', 'you?']
```

Here we split `text` on one or more whitespace using `re.split()` into a list.

```python
import re

pattern = r"[,;]"  # Match comma or semicolon
text = "apple, banana; orange, pear"

split_result = re.split(pattern, text)
print(split_result)

# Output: ['apple', ' banana', ' orange', ' pear']
```

Here we split `text` on comma or semicolon into a list using `re.split()`. 

Note that the delimiters do not appear in the result list elements, they are just used to split the string.

# re.findall function

`re.findall()` is a function provided by Python's `re` module to find all substrings in a string that match a regex pattern, returning them as a list of matched items. 

The function signature is:

```python
re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)
```

Where:

- `pattern`: The regex pattern to match.
- `string`: The string to search in.
- `flags`: Optional flags to modify the matching.

Here is a simple example:

```python
import re

pattern = r"\d+"  # Match one or more digits
text = "There are 123 apples and 456 bananas."

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)

# Output: ['123', '456']
```

Here we use `re.findall()` to find all numbers in string `text`, returning a list of matched items.

```python  
import re

pattern = r"\b\w{4}\b"  # Match 4 letter words 
text = "apple banana orange pear grapes"

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(matches)

# Output: ['pear']
```

Here we use `re.findall()` to find all 4 letter words in `text`, returning only "pear" which matches.

Note that `re.findall()` returns a list of matches, not grouped results. 

# re.finditer function

`re.finditer()` is a function in Python's `re` module to find all substrings matching a regex pattern, returning matched objects in an iterator. Each matched object contains details like start and end positions of the match. 

The function signature is:

```python
re.finditer(pattern, string, flags=0)
```

Where: 

- `pattern`: The regex pattern to match.
- `string`: The string to search in.
- `flags`: Optional flags to modify the matching.

Here is an example usage:

```python
import re

pattern = r"\d+"  
text = "There are 123 apples and 456 bananas."

matches = re.finditer(pattern, text)
for match in matches:
    print("Match found:", match.group(), "at position:", match.start(), "-", match.end())
    
# Output: 
# Match found: 123 at position: 10 - 13  
# Match found: 456 at position: 23 - 26
```

Here we use `re.finditer()` to find all numbers in `text`, iterating through the matcher to output the details of each match.

`re.finditer()` returns an iterator, generating a match object each iteration. This is useful for finding multiple matches in large texts since it does not generate all matches at once, saving memory.

# re.compile function

The `re.compile()` function in Python's `re` module is used to compile a regex pattern into a reusable regex object. Compiling improves performance and reduces repeating compilation overhead when using the same pattern multiple times.

The function signature is:

```python
re.compile(pattern, flags=0)
```

Where:

- `pattern`: The regex pattern to compile.
- `flags`: Optional flags to modify the matching.

Here is a simple example usage:

```python
import re

pattern = r"\d+"  
text = "There are 123 apples and 456 bananas."

compiled_pattern = re.compile(pattern)
matches = compiled_pattern.findall(text) 

print(matches)

# Output: ['123', '456']
```

Here we compile the regex pattern using `re.compile()` and then use the compiled pattern for finding matches. This improves performance when reusing the same pattern.

The main advantage of using `re.compile()` is that it allows you to reuse the same regex pattern in your code without recompiling each time. This is very useful when you need to use the same pattern multiple times, reducing performance overhead.

# Regex flags - Optional modifiers

Regular expressions can contain optional flags modifiers to control the matching behavior. The modifiers are specified as an optional flag. Multiple flags can be specified by bitwise OR-ing them. For example, re.I | re.M sets the I and M flags:

| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| re.I | Make the matching case-insensitive |
| re.L | Locale-aware matching |
| re.M | Multiline matching, affecting ^ and $ | 
| re.S | Make the '.' match all characters, including newline |
| re.U | Unicode matching based on Unicode character properties. Affects \w, \W, \b, \B |
| re.X | Verbose mode - allows writing expressions more readably with whitespace and comments |

# Regex pattern syntax

The pattern string uses special syntax to denote a regex pattern:

Letters and digits signify themselves. A regex pattern with letters and digits will match the same literal text.

Many letters and digits preceded by a backslash take on different meanings. 

Punctuation marks only match themselves when escaped, otherwise they denote special meaning.

The backslash itself needs to be escaped to match a literal backslash.

Since regexes often contain backslashes, it's common to use raw strings to represent them, where r'\t' matches a literal tab character.

Here are the special elements in regex pattern syntax. Some change meaning if you use optional flags in the pattern:

| Pattern | Description |
|-|-|
| ^ | Matches beginning of string |
| $ | Matches end of string |
| . | Matches any single character except newline '\n'. With re.DOTALL flag, matches everything including newline |  
| [...] | Match a set of characters enclosed in brackets. E.g. [amk] matches 'a', 'm', or 'k' |
| [^...] | Negated set - matches characters NOT in the brackets. E.g. [^abc] matches anything except 'a', 'b', 'c' |
| r* | Match 0 or more occurrences of preceding expression |
| r+ | Match 1 or more occurrences of preceding expression | 
| r? | Match 0 or 1 occurrence in a non-greedy way |
| r{n} | Match exactly n occurrences of preceding expression. E.g. o{2} cannot match 'o' in "Bob" but matches two o's in "food" |
| r{n,} | Match at least n occurrences of preceding expression. E.g. o{2,} cannot match "o" in "Bob" but matches all o's in "foooood" | 
| r{n,m} | Match between n to m occurrences in a greedy way |
| a\|b | Match either a or b |
| (r) | Group regular expression, remembering matched text | 
| (?imx) | Set i, m, or x flags only for expression inside group |
| (?-imx) | Turn off i, m, or x flags only for expression inside group |
| (?:r) | Similar to (...), but does not capture match |
| (?imx:r) | Turn on i, m, or x flags only for expression inside group |
| (?-imx:r) | Turn off i, m, or x flags only for expression inside group | 
| (?#...) | Comment - ignored by regex engine |
| (?=r) | Positive lookahead - Assert expression matches here without consuming text | 
| (?!r) | Negative lookahead - Assert expression does NOT match here |
| (?>r) | Match independent pattern without backtracking |
| \w | Match word character (letters, digits, underscore) |
| \W | Match non-word character | 
| \s | Match whitespace character |
| \S | Match non-whitespace character |
| \d | Match digit character | 
| \D | Match non-digit character |
| \A | Match at start of string |
| \Z | Match at end of string or before newline at end | 
| \z | Match absolute end of string |
| \G | Match at position where last match finished |
| \b | Match word boundary between \w and \W |  
| \B | Match non-word boundary |
| \n, \t, etc. | Match newline, tab, etc |
| \1...\9 | Match nth grouped subexpression |
| \10 | Match nth grouped subexpression if it matched already, else refers to octal representation |
