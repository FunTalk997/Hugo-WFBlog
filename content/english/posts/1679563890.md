# Overview:
Hello everyone, today I want to explore with you a magical technique in Python - decorators. They can not only simplify our code, but also add some magic to functions and classes. Let's find out what decorators are, why we should use them, and how to use them!

# What are decorators:  
First, let's understand what are decorators. Simply put, a decorator is a technique that allows you to add extra functionality to functions or classes without modifying the source code. They leverage Python's closure and first-class functions features and are widely used in the developer community.

# Why use decorators:
You may wonder, why should we use decorators? The answer is simple: they can reduce duplicate code and focus concerns on the core logic. By using decorators, we can extract some common logic to increase code reusability and maintainability. This allows us to focus more on solving problems rather than getting bogged down in trivial details.

# Simple decorators:
Let's start with a simple decorator example. Take a look at the following:

```python
def greeting_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Hello!")
        func()
        print("Nice to meet you!")
    return wrapper

@greeting_decorator
def greet():
    print("How are you?")

greet()
```
Here we define a decorator named `greeting_decorator` that prints some friendly greetings before and after executing the original function. By using the `@greeting_decorator` syntax, we apply the decorator to the `greet` function. Running this code prints:

```txt
Hello!  
How are you?
Nice to meet you!
```

Yes! The greetings are successfully added. This is the charm of decorators.

# Decorator syntax "@":
The above example shows the decorator syntax "@". By using the `@` symbol before a function definition, we can conveniently apply a decorator without having to manually call the decorator function before calling the function. This makes the code more concise and readable.

# Decorator arguments:
For some more complex cases, we may need to pass arguments into the decorator. This allows us to customize the behavior of the decorator based on different requirements. Here is an example of a decorator that takes arguments:

```python
def repeat_decorator(num_times):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper():
            for _ in range(num_times):
                func()
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@repeat_decorator(3)  
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

greet()
```

Here we define a decorator named `repeat_decorator` which takes a `num_times` argument representing how many times the function should be called. By using `@repeat_decorator(3)`, we tell the decorator to repeat the `greet` function 3 times. Running this prints:

```txt
Hello, world!
Hello, world! 
Hello, world!
```

Feels a bit magical, doesn't it?

# Class decorators:
In addition to decorating functions, decorators can also decorate classes. Using decorators on classes allows adding extra behaviors or attributes to classes. Here is a simple example of a class decorator:

```python
def add_method_decorator(cls):
    def print_message(self):
        print("This method is added dynamically!")
    cls.print_message = print_message
    return cls

@add_method_decorator
class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()
obj.print_message()
```

Here we define a decorator named `add_method_decorator` that dynamically adds a `print_message` method to the class. By using `@add_method_decorator`, we apply the decorator to `MyClass`. Running this prints: 

```txt
This method is added dynamically!
```

Amazingly, we have dynamically added a method to the class! This flexibility surely adds lots of possibilities to our code.

# Parameterized class decorators: 
Of course, we can also pass arguments to class decorators for finer-grained control. This allows us to customize behaviors based on different parameters. Here is an example of a parameterized class decorator:

```python
def repeat_methods(num_times):
    def decorator(cls):
        class NewClass:
            def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
                self.instance = cls(*args, **kwargs)

            def __getattribute__(self, name):
                original_method = getattr(self.instance, name)
                if callable(original_method):
                    def new_method(*args, **kwargs):
                        for _ in range(num_times):
                            original_method(*args, **kwargs)
                    return new_method
                else:
                    return original_method
        return NewClass
    return decorator

@repeat_methods(2)
class MyClass:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello!")

obj = MyClass()
obj.greet()
```

Here we define a decorator named `repeat_methods` which takes a `num_times` argument representing how many times methods should be called. By using `@repeat_methods(2)`, we tell the decorator to repeat all methods in `MyClass` 2 times. Running this prints:

```txt
Hello!
Hello!
```

# Order of decorators:
Finally, we need to pay attention to the order of decorators. When applying multiple decorators, their order of execution is from inner to outer. This means we need to carefully consider the order to ensure correct logic. Here is an example of a function decorated by multiple decorators:


```python 
def greeting_decorator1(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Hello 1!")
        func()
        print("Nice to meet you 1!")
    return wrapper

def greeting_decorator2(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Hello 2!")
        func()
        print("Nice to meet you 2!")
    return wrapper

def greeting_decorator3(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Hello 3!")
        func()
        print("Nice to meet you 3!")
    return wrapper

@greeting_decorator1  
@greeting_decorator2
@greeting_decorator3
def greet():
    print("How are you?")

greet()
```

Running this prints:

```txt
Hello 1!  
Hello 2!
Hello 3!
How are you?
Nice to meet you 3!  
Nice to meet you 2!
Nice to meet you 1!
```

# Summary:
Through this post, we have learned what decorators are, why to use them, and how to use them. Decorators are a powerful and fun feature in Python that can make our code more concise, maintainable, and magical. Hope this helps you better understand and apply decorators! Have fun exploring more surprising techniques and wonderful code in the Python world!
