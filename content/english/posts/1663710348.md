# Disk Mounting

(1) View currently unmounted disks

```
# View disk information
fdisk -l
```

The following information appears, where /dev/vdb is the unmounted disk.

(2) Disk Partitioning

```
# For disks below 2TB

# Partition the disk /dev/vdb
fdisk /dev/vdb
# Enter n -> p -> 1 -> Enter -> Enter -> w sequentially
```

![photo](/images/posts/1663710348/image2.png)

n: Add a partition

p: Primary partition

1: Partition as the first partition, i.e., /dev/vdb1

Two Enter keys indicate the start and end disk sector sizes

w: Write to the disk

```
# For disks above 2TB
# Set up disk partition
parted /dev/vdb
# Enter print -> mklabel gpt -> mkpart extended 0% 100% -> print -> quit as prompted
```

print: Output disk information

mklabel gpt: Partition using GPT format

mkpart extended 0% 100%: Set the entire disk space as one partition

print: Output disk information again (the partition information should be visible now)

quit: Exit partitioning

(3) Format the disk and write a file system

```
# Format the disk, /dev/vdb1 is the created partition
mkfs.ext4 -T largefile -n /dev/vdb1
# -n is a virtual parameter that simulates the operation without formatting. This allows you to see the effects of different formatting parameters.
# This command can virtually view the number of inodes. In Linux file systems, each file corresponds to an inode. The default inode size is currently 256 bytes.
# Optimized formatting command to reduce the number of inodes
mkfs.ext4 -T largefile /dev/vdb1 # This command actually formats the disk
```

(5) Create a disk mount directory

Note: The directory must be a non-existent or unused directory, otherwise the target folder will be overwritten.

```
# Switch to the root directory
cd /
# Create the xsy folder
mkdir xsy
```

(6) Mount the new disk to a node in the operating system

There are two ways to do this: 1) Mount using the disk partition name, 2) Mount using the disk UUID.

Mount using the disk partition name

a. Mount the disk to the /xsy directory

```
# Mount the /dev/vdb1 partition to the /xsy directory
mount /dev/vdb1 /xsy
```

b. View disk information to confirm if the new disk is successfully mounted

```
# View disk information
df -h
```

The following image indicates that /dev/vdb1 is mounted to the /xsy directory.

c. Set automatic mount on boot

```
# Edit the system disk configuration file /etc/fstab
vim /etc/fstab
# Append the following line at the end of the file
/dev/vdb1  /xsy   ext4    defaults    0 0
# Save and exit
:wq
```

d. The disk is now mounted.

Mount using the disk UUID

a. View the disk UUID

```
# View the UUID of the partition /dev/vdb1
blkid /dev/vdb1
```

b. Mount the disk using the UUID

```
# Edit the system disk configuration file /etc/fstab
vim /etc/fstab
# Append the following line at the end of the file
UUID=UUID_you_obtained  /xsy   ext4    defaults    0 0
# Save and exit
:wq
```

c. Reload the disk configuration

```
mount -a
```

d. View disk information to confirm if the new disk is successfully mounted

```
# View disk information
df -h
```

# Disk Unmounting

```
# Enter the command umount followed by the source of the mounted device (/dev/sdb1) or the mount point (/mnt)
umount /dev/vdb1
# Delete the previous mount configuration
vim /etc/fstab
# Reset the partition
fdisk /dev/vdb -> d (delete partition) -> w (save)
# View disk information
fdisk -l (view)
```
