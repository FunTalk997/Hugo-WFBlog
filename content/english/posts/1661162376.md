1. The client submits a YARN application to the ResourceManager.
2. The ResourceManager initializes (starts) containers. With the assistance of the NodeManager, the containers are launched. If it's the first launch, the container includes the ApplicationMaster.
3. The ApplicationMaster checks if there are enough resources available. If there are, it starts running tasks.
4. If there are not enough resources, the ApplicationMaster requests resources from the ResourceManager.
5. Once the ApplicationMaster obtains the resources, it starts launching containers. With the assistance of the NodeManager, the containers are launched, and the application starts running.
