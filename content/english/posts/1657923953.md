# Install

Installation methods vary depending on the operating system. The following operations are performed on Windows. For other operating systems, see [Hugo Installation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)。

## Install Hugo

The NewBee theme is powered by the Hugo engine, a fast and modern static website generator written in the Go language.

For Windows, Hugo officially uses a package manager or pre-built binaries for installation, if you don't have one on your computer, please download one first. For details, please go to: Hugo Installation on Windows

### Method 1 Package Manager

Install hugo using the PowerShell command:

::: tabs

@tab Chocolatey

Chocolatey is a free and open source package manager for Windows. This will install an extended version of Hugo:

```PowerShell
PS > choco install hugo-extended
```

@tab Scoop

Scoop is a free and open source package manager for Windows. This will install an extended version of Hugo:

```PowerShell
PS > scoop install hugo-extended
```

@tab Winget

Winget is Microsoft's official free open source package manager for Windows. This will install an extended version of Hugo:

```PowerShell
PS > winget install Hugo.Hugo.Extended
```

@tab Docker

Erlend Klakegg Bergheim generously maintains Docker images based on Alpine Linux, Busybox, Debian, and Ubuntu images.

```PowerShell
PS > docker pull klakegg/hugo
```

:::

After installation, verify whether the installation is successful. Enter the following command line:

```PowerShell
PS > hugo version
```

If the output looks something like this:

```PowerShell
hugo v0.117.0-b2f0696cad918fb61420a6aff173eb36662b406e+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2023-08-07T12:49:48Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
```

The installation is successful.

### Method 2 Prebuilt binary file

Pre-built binaries are available for a variety of operating systems and architectures. Access to [the latest version](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/latest) page, then scroll down to the "assets".

1. Download the archive of the required version, operating system, and architecture

Hugo is available in two versions: standard and extended. With the extended version, you can:

- The image is encoded in WebP format when processing. You can decode WebP images using either version.
- Use the embedded LibSass translator to translate Sass into CSS. No extended version is required to use the Dart Sass translator.

We recommend that you install the extended version.

2. Retrieve the archive

3. Move the executable file to the desired directory

4. Add the directory to the PATH environment variable

5. Verify that you have the permission to execute the file

```PowerShell
PS > hugo version
```

If the output looks something like this:

```PowerShell

```

The installation is successful.

## Install NewBee

To create a new project, first create a directory as the root directory of your blog. The sample directory file name is `myblog`. Hugo provides a quick way to create a website by using the `new site` command:

```PowerShell
PS > hugo new site myblog
```

Get the following file (the location of the file depends on the directory you are in when executing the command) :

NewBee theme of warehouse is: [https://github.com/xioyito/NewBee](https://github.com/xioyito/NewBee), which has the following two methods to install NewBee theme:

::: tabs

@tab Method 1

Download the theme of the latest version of the [.zip](https://github.com/xioyito/NewBee/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file, after decompression in `themes` directory.

@tab Method 2

Clone the theme to the `themes` directory:

```PowerShell
PS > cd myblog
PS myblog > git clone https://github.com/xioyito/NewBee.git themes/NewBee
```

:::

# Start

With both Hugo and NewBee installed, we're ready to start our blog's "Hello World."

Replace hugo.toml

Go to the `themes/NewBee/config-example` directory and copy the `hugo.toml` file, replacing the `myblog/hugo.toml` file.

## New article

```PowerShell
PS myblog > hugo new "posts/first-post.md"
```

You may need an about page, so:

```PowerShell
PS myblog > hugo new "about/_index.md"
```

The editorial content using the Markdown, about the Markdown basic grammar, please refer to: [Markdown tutorial](https://markdown.com.cn/basic-syntax/)

## Start the local server

```PowerShell
PS myblog > hugo server -D
```

Open your browser: http://localhost:1313/, this is the home page of our website, you can quickly preview the effect of the website.

1. When you run hugo server -D, if the file content changes, the page will refresh automatically with the change.
2. The difference between hugo server -D and hugo server: The latter does not render articles with the pre-parameter draft: true, which means that you will not see any information about the article when previewing the website.

# Syntax highlighting style

The way hugo finds the file is like this: first look for the website root directory `myblog` under the file, if not, then look for `myblog/themes/Newbee` under. Therefore, in theory, any file in the root directory can overwrite the corresponding file under the theme file. To avoid errors, you are advised to modify the theme file in the root directory.

Syntax highlighting, Hugo based on [chroma](https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/), and provides enough style style for your choice. If the NewBee theme's default highlighting style doesn't work for you, you can modify it as follows:

Do the following first:

```PowerShell
PS > hugo gen chromastyles --style=Your preferred style name > syntax.css
```

This will give you a `syntax.css` file, depending on the directory in which you executed the above command, and then copy it to the `myblog/static/css` folder. Under normal circumstances, it is not necessary to modify it, of course, it is not impossible, it depends on your mood.

If you also want to change the syntax highlighting style in dark mode, the operation is the same as above, just replace `syntax-dark.css` with `syntax-dark.css` on the command line.

If there is a display problem with syntax highlighting, just modify `syntax.css`, and modify `syntax-dark.css` for dark mode.

# Deployment

With everything in place, it's time to put our website on the web. You can use [Netlify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/), [Render] (HTTP: / / https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deploymen T/hosting - on - render /), [Firebase] (https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-firebase/), [making] (HTTP: / / https://gohugo. io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) and more. The following is a brief introduction to the process of deploying to Github, and more ways to deploy and host.

## Prepare

Deployment on Github, we need to use Github Page, it is a web hosting service provided by GitHub, can host static pages, very suitable for the construction of blogs. First create a Repository in your github account and name it `your Github account name.github.io`, for example, my repository name `WaterFish121506.github.io`.

## Generate static page files

```PowerShell
PS myblog > hugo
```

This command generates a `public` directory under the root directory, which contains all the static content and resources of your site.

Before generating static pages, change the `baseURL` in the `hugo.toml` file to the URL of your blog: `https:// your github account.github.io`.

## Deploy to Github

Go to the `public` folder and upload the file using git.

```PowerShell
PS myblog > cd public
PS public > git init    # Initialize the repository
PS public > git remote add origin https://github.com/Your Github account name/Your Github account name.github.io.git    # Link remote repository
PS public > git add .
PS public > git commit -m "first commit"
PS public > git push -u origin master
```

When updating the article in the future, it is also used to generate new page files with hugo and upload files with git.

```PowerShell
PS myblog > hugo
PS myblog > cd public
PS public > git add .
PS public > git commit -m "first commit"
PS public > git push
```

When uploading files to Github, there may be problems related to the use of git, please solve it yourself.

Wait a moment, you can open our website: 'https:// your github account name.github.

How long you wait has a lot to do with your Internet connection.
